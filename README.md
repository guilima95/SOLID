# The **SOLID** principles are a set of design guidelines for writing maintainable and scalable software.

**S**ingle Responsibility Principle: *A class should only have one reason to change*.

**O**pen/Closed Principle: *Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification*.

**L**iskov Substitution Principle: *Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types*.

**I**nterface Segregation Principle: *Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use*.

**D**ependency Inversion Principle: *High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, both should depend on abstractions*.
